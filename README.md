**Social Evaluative Implications of Auditory Adaptation to Human Voices**

This repository contains all of the materials for a paper looking at the social evaluative implications of auditory adaptation to human voices. 

**Stimuli** - contains all stimuli used for four studies, along with the Praat code used to manipulate the fundamental frequency of adaptors and the order in which adapting and test voices were presented to participants.

_Test stimuli._ For Study 1, test stimuli were audio recordings of 20 young adult women reciting the sentence: “Hi, I’m a student at UCLA.” . For Study 2, test stimuli were audio recordings of 20 young adult men reciting the same sentence. Studies 3 and 4 used the test stimuli from both Studies 1 and 2, yielding a total of 40 test voices (20 women, 20 men) in each study. Samples were recorded digitally (M-Audio Microtrack recorder, 16-bit amplitude resolution, 44.1 kHz sampling rate) using an AKG E535 condenser microphone placed approximately 15cm from the mouth. Stimuli varied naturally in duration, fundamental frequency (F0), and voice quality.

_Adapting stimuli._ Adaptors varied between studies and included both masculinized and feminized exemplars that would be gender-atypical and gender-typical relative to test stimuli. Study 1 adaptors were generated from recordings of 5 young adult women producing the same sentence as test stimuli. These recordings were manipulated to be more masculine or more feminine using the VT-Change script (C. Darwin) in Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2012). We altered F0, a well-established (see Kreiman & Sidtis, 2011) sexually dimorphic aspect of voice using PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap Add) resynthesis. For masculinized (gender-atypical) versions, F0 values were lowered to 65% or 75% of baseline. For feminized (gender-typical) versions, F0 was increased to 130% of baseline.

**Qualtrics** - contains .qsf files for all of the studies ran through Qualtrics. 

**Analysis** - contains the data and RMarkdown analysis code used for all 4 studies.
